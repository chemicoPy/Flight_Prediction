# Flight_Prediction

This study has been devoted to predict delay based on machine learning approach and through considering delay time duration of the flights that had been engaged.

The result has shown that it is possible to predict the probability of delay in higher levels through specifying low level factors

A model was trained using both smaller and much bigger flight data to adapt to whichever it's been used on and the respective data & model files were saved in this repositories...
